# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is part of Task 03 from my SkillCraft Technology Internship. The Tic Tac Toe Web Application is an interactive and user-friendly game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play alternately, automatically detects the winner or a draw, and provides the option to restart the game.
